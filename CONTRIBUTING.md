# Use smart git messages 
> Always use ```:``` in commit messages, commits without  ```:``` will be auto-rejected
- ```add:```    small addition 
- ```feat:```   completed feature
- ```fix:```    fix "completed" feature
- ```ref:```    refactor
- ```doc:```    document code without any code changes
- ```opt:```    optimalizations :D 
- ```test:```   working with tests
- ```change:``` when changing/ breaking shared code 

Also some automatic commit messages can be used if they pass
